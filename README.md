Key Considerations Before Implementation:
 * Table Schemas: You'll need to replace placeholder table and column names (e.g., SourceTable, DimTable, BusinessKey, Attribute1, EffectiveDate, ExpiryDate, IsCurrent, Version, PreviousValue) with your actual schema.
 * Primary Keys/Surrogate Keys: Ensure your dimension tables have appropriate primary keys (usually a surrogate key) and the source tables have a business key.
 * Performance: For large datasets, consider indexing relevant columns, especially business keys and date columns.
 * Error Handling: In a production environment, you'd add TRY...CATCH blocks for robust error handling.
 * Transaction Management: BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT TRAN/ROLLBACK TRAN are crucial for data integrity.
 * Data Types: Ensure data types match between source and dimension tables.
